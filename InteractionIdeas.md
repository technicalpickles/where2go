# Initial screen possibilities #

  * one text area to type your current location
> > -Jay: I like this idea, keeping it simple on the first page. Perhaps location & type of spot.
  * map to click/drill down into
> > -Jay: Perhaps this is best for the initial search results, I think users might be overwhelmed seeing a large map with the entire listing of markers in the Boston area when they first load the page.
  * some simple options
    * search radius
    * type of spot
> > -Jay: Maybe we can have a sidebar in the initial search results, to further filter via advanced options. See www.trulia.com for a good example of this.
  * expandable "advanced" options panel
    * opening hours
    * whatever else we can come up with

# Refining UI #
  * sidebar with specific categories, checkbox to en/disable
  * full advanced panel available
  * ability to drag center point elsewhere
