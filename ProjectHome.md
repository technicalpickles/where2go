Move into a new neighbor and wanted to know all the local bars, resturants, dry cleaners, and so on? Sure, there's some things that do that, kind of, but none of them were quite what we had hoped for.

Sure, Google Maps and Yelp let you do it. Our issue was that they don't really give you a good feel for the locale, because search results usually are limited to only 10 or so venues at once.

Here are some situations we are aiming to be helpful for.

  * I just got off the T at Government Center, and dying for a drink. What are some bars I can hit up?
  * I moved to Kendall Square, and have no idea where to go out to eat.
  * It's 2am on a Saturday night. Where can I still pickup a pizza?
